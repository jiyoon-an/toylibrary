				<p>Overdue toys will incur a fine except in exceptional circumstances (e.g. illness).</p>
				<p>No further toys may be borrowed until all fines are paid. Persistent lateness in returning toys may result in cancellation of membership.</p>
				<p style="font-weight:bold">Dirty toys</p>
				<p>We want our children to play with clean and tidy toys. Kindly please return them in the condition you would like to receive them. Unfortunately, if you attempt to return any dirty toy, we will ask you to clean it first.</p>
				<p style="font-weight:bold">Loss and/or damage</p>
				<p>Toys break even in normal play. Donâ€™t be embarrassed if this happens to you. Please notify us of missing or broken parts when you return the toys.</p>

				<p style="font-weight:bold">Checking Toys</p>
				<p>When you are in the library please be aware that each toy is packed and checked in its own bags or boxes. It would be appreciated that you keep each toy in this condition. Toys must be checked on issue and return.</p>
				<p style="font-weight:bold">Toys at home</p>
				<p>At the end each play session at home, we ask that you put the library toys away in their library bags or boxes. This keeps them separate from your own toys and makes it much easier when you come to return them.</p>
				<p>Please do not exchange Library toys with friends even if they are toy library members. All library toys borrowed by you must remain in your home.</p>
				<p style="font-weight:bold">Cancellation of membership</p>
				<p>Membership can be cancelled by you at anytime. However, it may take up to 1 month to reimburse the bond.</p>
				<p>If you decide to discontinue your use of the library for any reason, we would appreciate you notifying us so that someone else who in the waiting list may have the opportunity to participate.<p>
				<p>Please keep us informed of any change in your address or phone number.</p>
				<p>This is your library and we need your ideas to make it work. Please tell us if you have any suggestion, queries or concerns.</p>
				<p>Any amendments and addition to the rules will be notified through a newsletter to members.</p>
